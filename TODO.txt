TODOs:

- Create an icon for the site

Engineering TODO list:
- Finish the new recipe metadata
  - Need to set the recipe subclass dropdown based on the recipe type selected
  - Play around with the layout to see if I can make it bigger
  - Make sure that all the fields we added (type, subclass, baking time, etc...)
    are in the datamodel. All of those need to be modeled a little more carefully,
    but I'll just start with simple numbers.
- Add ability to cancel out of edit mode
- Validation on the fields in the recipe
- Integrate the recipes list and single recipe page
- Provide way to really save recipes
- Think about making it pretty
- Investigate mustasche for templating
- Think about the path structure and how to model it
- Figure out a better way to organize java script files
- Go over performance advice for javascript
- Figure out a better system for generating the headers we need (see what CM does...)
- Use jslint
- Testing...
- Remove the Django hacks and integrate with a true web server (apache??)
- We re-render the entire view each time with backbone. There are apparently
ways to make this more efficient.
- Test commit
