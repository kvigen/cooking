- The layout will have 3 main pages
  1. The main page. This will just be a welcome screen for now
  2. The individual recipe page. This is discussed in more depth below
  3. The all recipes page. This will contain a list of all the recipes for the user


Version 1 Features:
- The ability to create recipes. Recipes will have a 3 column format. The first
  column is the # of the ingredient, the second is the unit, the 3rd in the
  ingredient itself. For example, 1 cup brown sugar.
- The ability to save recipes. These recipes will show up in the all recipes page.
- The ability to change recipes and see information about what that would do to
  the results.
- The ability to take "actions" on a recipe. An action would be something like
  doubling the recip or making it gluten free
- The ability for a user to log into the site and maintain their own recipe list.
  We will probably support logging in through facebook or Google

Potential Future Features:
- Converting units for ingredients
- Substitution options for ingredients
- Recommendations on cooking time based on pan size
- The ability to share recipes
- Should the recipes list just be a dropdown (see http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/components.html#navs)
  - Or should the pages just be embedded together
- Information about the recipe, like calories
- Lineage (ie knowing what recipes were modifications of other recipes)
- A better way to organize recipes, by type, etc...
